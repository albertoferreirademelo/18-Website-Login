# Website login with selenium
This was a personal project were I used selenium to login to different websites. In many cities of Sweden to be able to get an apartment, you should register yourself to different websites (depending of the company and city) and get in a queue. The task was monotonous so I created a program to automatically login to the websites I was registered to.

PS. I have removed my logins and passwords. :)
